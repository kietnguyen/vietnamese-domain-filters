# Vietnamese Domain Filters

Domain filters for Vietnamese internet users.

The filters include [ads filter](https://github.com/snhv/vietnamese-domain-filters/blob/master/ads) (to block advertisements, trackers, popups, and other annoyances) and [adults filter](https://github.com/snhv/vietnamese-domain-filters/blob/master/adults) (to block pornography, prostitution, gambling, and other inappropriate sites).

The filters are recommended to be used with [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) or [Adguard](https://github.com/AdguardTeam). To subscribe to these filters, please add the following raw file for [ads filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snhv/vietnamese-domain-filters/master/ads) and [adults filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snhv/vietnamese-domain-filters/master/adults).

The ads filter particularly should be used in conjunction with a general ads filter such as [Fanboy List](https://fanboy.co.nz/) or [Adguard Filter](https://adguard.com/en/filters.html). 

Kindly note that these domain filters, as the name suggests, only block at domain level and hence is not as comprehensive as URL filters. For Vietnamese URL filter, please use [ABPVN](http://abpvn.com/) instead.
